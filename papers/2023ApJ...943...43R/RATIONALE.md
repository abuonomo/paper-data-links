construct the script for querying solar data relevant to the context of the study on solar coronal density turbulence and magnetic field strength at the source regions of two successive metric type II radio bursts that occurred on 2020 May 29. The context mentions observations of these bursts, which are associated with the leading edge of an EUV flux rope/CME and its interaction with a neighboring coronal structure. Given this, we need to focus on instruments that can provide data on CMEs, EUV flux ropes, and potentially the magnetic field in the corona. The instruments of interest from the VSO interface that could provide relevant data are AIA (Atmospheric Imaging Assembly) on SDO (Solar Dynamics Observatory) for EUV observations and LASCO (Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph) on SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) for CME observations. Although the context does not directly mention specific wavelengths or detectors, we can infer that AIA's EUV channels and LASCO's coronagraphs (C2 and C3) would be relevant. The specific time range of interest is around the date 2020 May 29, corresponding to the occurrence of the type II radio bursts.
