This script queries for AIA and LASCO C2 and C3 data around the time of the observed type II radio bursts on 2020 May 29. The AIA data can provide insights into the EUV flux rope, while LASCO data can help analyze the CMEs. The queries are displayed, and the data download commands are commented out.
