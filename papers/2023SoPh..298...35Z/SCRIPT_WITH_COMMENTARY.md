This script is designed to query the specific observations detailed in the context, using the correct instruments and their capabilities as per the VSO interface table. The queries are structured to reflect the data used in the context, focusing on the time ranges, wavelengths, and physical observables of interest. The `Fido.fetch` commands are commented out to adhere to the directive of not running them, but they can be uncommented to download the data as needed.
