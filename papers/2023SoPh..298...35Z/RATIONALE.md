produce the script. We need to construct queries for each of the instruments mentioned in the context, focusing on the specific time ranges, wavelengths, and physical observables detailed in the paper. The goal is to retrieve data that will allow us to analyze the dynamics of the prominence eruption and the associated CME as observed by multiple instruments across different spacecraft. We will ensure that the queries are specific to the context provided, using only the instruments and their capabilities as listed in the VSO interface.
