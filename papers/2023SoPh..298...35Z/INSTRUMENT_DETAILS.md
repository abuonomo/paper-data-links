# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper reports on the multiwavelength observations of an erupting prominence and the associated coronal mass ejection (CME) that occurred on May 13, 2013. The observations were made using a variety of instruments on different spacecraft, including the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The prominence exhibited rapid rotation and was supported by a highly twisted magnetic flux rope, which likely triggered the eruption due to kink instability. The paper details the instruments used, their observational capabilities, and the data they collected, which helped in analyzing the 3D morphology, kinematics, and evolution of the CME.

## Instrumentation Details

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA was used to observe the prominence in high resolution across multiple extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of erupting prominence
- **Time Range**: 13:30 – 18:30 UT
- **Wavelength(s)**: 171, 304 Å
- **Physical Observable**: Prominence eruption dynamics
- **Additional Comments**: Images captured helped in analyzing the prominence's rotation and structural evolution.

### Sun Watcher using Active Pixel System detector and image processing (SWAP) on board PROBA 2
- **General Comments**:
   - SWAP provided observations in EUV, capturing the larger field of view than AIA.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of prominence rising and writhing motion
- **Time Range**: 17:09 – 17:51 UT
- **Wavelength(s)**: 174 Å
- **Physical Observable**: Rising and writhing motion of the prominence
- **Additional Comments**: SWAP's observations were crucial in identifying the writhing motion suggesting kink instability.

### Extreme-UltraViolet Imager (EUVI) on board the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO)
- **General Comments**:
   - EUVI captured the event from unique vantage points of STEREO Ahead (STA) and Behind (STB), providing a comprehensive view of the prominence and CME from multiple angles.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Multi-angle observation of prominence
- **Time Range**: 13:30 – 20:30 UT
- **Wavelength(s)**: 195, 304, 284 Å (STA); 304 Å (STB)
- **Physical Observable**: Prominence structure and eruption dynamics
- **Additional Comments**: The observations from different angles were essential for 3D reconstruction of the CME.

### Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO observed the associated CME in the corona using its C2 and C3 coronagraphs.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of CME development
- **Time Range**: 17:24 – 19:54 UT (C2), 18:18 – 19:54 UT (C3)
- **Wavelength(s)**: White light (WL)
- **Physical Observable**: CME structure and propagation
- **Additional Comments**: Provided critical data on the CME's morphology and kinematics.

### COR1 and COR2 Coronagraphs on board STEREO
- **General Comments**:
   - These instruments provided additional views of the CME, complementing the observations made by LASCO.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Detailed imaging of CME
- **Time Range**: 17:15 – 18:20 UT (COR1), 17:30 – 20:00 UT (COR2)
- **Wavelength(s)**: White light (WL)
- **Physical Observable**: CME expansion and structure
- **Additional Comments**: Enabled detailed analysis of the CME's evolution and structure from multiple viewpoints.

These instruments collectively provided a detailed and comprehensive dataset that allowed for the analysis of the prominence's behavior and the associated CME's evolution, contributing significantly to understanding the dynamics of such solar events.
