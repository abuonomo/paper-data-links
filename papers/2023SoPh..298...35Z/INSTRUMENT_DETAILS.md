# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper reports on the multiwavelength observations of an erupting prominence and the associated coronal mass ejection (CME) that occurred on May 13, 2013. The observations were made using a variety of instruments on different spacecraft, including the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The prominence exhibited rapid rotation and was supported by a highly twisted magnetic flux rope, which likely triggered the eruption due to kink instability. The paper discusses the 3D morphology and kinematic evolution of the CME, which was reconstructed using the graduated cylindrical shell (GCS) modeling technique. The findings contribute to understanding the dynamics of solar eruptions and their potential impact on space weather.

## Instrumentation Details

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA was used to observe the erupting prominence in multiple extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths, providing detailed imagery of the event.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of prominence eruption
- **Time Range**: 13:30 – 18:30 UT
- **Wavelength(s)**: 171, 304 Å
- **Physical Observable**: Prominence structure and dynamics
- **Additional Comments**: Images captured helped in analyzing the rotation and structural evolution of the prominence.

### Sun Watcher using Active Pixel System detector and image processing (SWAP) on board PROBA 2
- **General Comments**:
   - SWAP provided observations with a larger field of view than AIA, which was crucial for capturing the full extent of the prominence eruption.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of prominence in larger field of view
- **Time Range**: 17:09 – 17:51 UT
- **Wavelength(s)**: 174 Å
- **Physical Observable**: Prominence eruption dynamics
- **Additional Comments**: SWAP's observations were key in identifying the writhing motions indicative of kink instability.

### Extreme-UltraViolet Imager (EUVI) on board the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO)
- **General Comments**:
   - EUVI on both STEREO-A and STEREO-B spacecraft provided unique side views of the prominence and CME from different perspectives.
