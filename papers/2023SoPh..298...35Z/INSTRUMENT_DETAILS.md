# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper reports on the multiwavelength observations of an erupting prominence and the associated coronal mass ejection (CME) that occurred on May 13, 2013. The observations were made using various instruments on board different spacecraft including the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The prominence exhibited rapid rotation and was supported by a highly twisted magnetic flux rope, which likely triggered the eruption due to kink instability. The paper details the instruments used, their observational capabilities, and the data they collected, which helped in understanding the dynamics of the eruption and provided insights into the 3D morphology and kinematic evolution of the associated CME.

## Instrumentation Details

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA was used to observe the erupting prominence in multiple extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths, providing detailed imagery of the event.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of prominence eruption
- **Time Range**: 13:30 – 18:30 UT
- **Wavelength(s)**: 171, 304, 94, 131, 193, 211, 335, 1600, 1700 Å
- **Physical Observable**: Prominence eruption dynamics, including rotation and rising motion
- **Additional Comments**: High-resolution images helped in analyzing the rapid rotation and the structure of the prominence.

### Sun Watcher using Active Pixel System detector and image processing (SWAP) on board PROBA 2
- **General Comments**:
   - SWAP provided observations of the prominence in a single EUV wavelength with a larger field of view than AIA.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of prominence and writhing motion
- **Time Range**: 17:09 – 17:51 UT
- **Wavelength(s)**: 174 Å
- **Physical Observable**: Prominence rise and writhing motion
- **Additional Comments**: SWAP's larger field of view was crucial for capturing the full extent of the prominence's motion.

### Extreme-UltraViolet Imager (EUVI) on board Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO)
- **General Comments**:
   - EUVI captured the event from two different perspectives (Ahead and Behind), providing a unique three-dimensional view of the eruption.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation from STEREO-A
- **Time Range**: 13:30 – 20:30 UT
- **Wavelength(s)**: 195, 304, 284 Å
- **Physical Observable**: Prominence eruption, flare ribbons, and post-flare loops
- **Additional Comments**: Images from STEREO-A showed the prominence as a long filament and captured the associated flare ribbons.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Observation from STEREO-B
- **Time Range**: 13:30 – 20:30 UT
- **Wavelength(s)**: 304 Å
- **Physical Observable**: Prominence eruption and writhing motion
- **Additional Comments**: STEREO-B's perspective was crucial for observing the writhing motion of the prominence.

### Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO observed the associated CME using its C2 and C3 coronagraphs, which capture white-light images of the corona.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of CME propagation
- **Time Range**: 17:24 – 19:54 UT (C2), 18:18 – 19:54 UT (C3)
- **Wavelength(s)**: White light
- **Physical Observable**: CME structure and propagation
- **Additional Comments**: LASCO's observations were integral to understanding the CME's structure and its propagation through the corona.

### COR1 and COR2 Coronagraphs on board STEREO
- **General Comments**:
   - These instruments provided additional views of the CME, aiding in the three-dimensional reconstruction of the event.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of CME from STEREO-A and STEREO-B
- **Time Range**: 17:10 – 20:09 UT (COR1 and COR2 on STEREO-B), 17:25 – 20:24 UT (COR1 and COR2 on STEREO-A)
- **Wavelength(s)**: White light
- **Physical Observable**: CME morphology and kinematics
- **Additional Comments**: The observations from different vantage points were crucial for the 3D reconstruction of the CME using the graduated cylindrical shell (GCS) modeling technique.
