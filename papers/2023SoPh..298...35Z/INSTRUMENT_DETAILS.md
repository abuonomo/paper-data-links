## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper reports on the multiwavelength observations of an erupting prominence and the associated coronal mass ejection (CME) on 13 May 2013. The event occurs behind the western limb in the field of view of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft. The prominence, supported by a highly twisted magnetic flux rope, exhibits rapid rotation in the counterclockwise direction during its rising motion, lasting for approximately 47 minutes. The rotation's average period, angular speed, and linear speed are calculated, with the total twist angle reaching considerably larger than the threshold for kink instability. The writhing motion is observed by SWAP in 174 Å and Extreme-UltraViolet Imager (EUVI) on board the behind Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft in 304 Å after reaching an apparent height of approximately 405 Mm, suggesting the prominence eruption is likely triggered by kink instability. A pair of conjugate flare ribbons and post-flare loops are observed by STA/EUVI. The 3D morphology and positions of the associated CME are derived using the graduated cylindrical shell (GCS) modeling, revealing a slow-rise phase and a fast-rise phase in the CME's kinetic evolution, triggered by the writhing motion. The paper concludes with a discussion on the implications of these findings for understanding solar eruptions and their potential impact on space weather forecasting.

## Instrumentation Details

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
